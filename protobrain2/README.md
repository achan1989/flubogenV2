This is intended to be opened in Visual Studio Code, using the Raspberry Pi Pico extension and the
Raspberry Pi debug probe.

I did this on Linux. If the project settings are bad for Windows, I'm sorry!

# Misc Notes

* max7456 is the OSD I think -- text overlay for the video screen inside the head
* led matrices are all ws2812b

# TODOs

"port the software"

* get the body logo outputs working (body0 = shoulders, body1 = legs)
* hook that up to the automatic brightness control
* be controlled from the animation files (face only?)
